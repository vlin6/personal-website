					<h3>Software Developer Intern, Tyler Technologies</h3>
					<p class="small">Summer 2014</p>
					<p>I made a RESTful API for a large Silverlight application with a C# back-end. I also worked on a responsive thin client written in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript which uses the aforementioned API. The core business logic was written in C#, with unit testing done in Jasmine and the MS Unit Testing Framework. The thin-client web app was written in TypeScript, AngularJS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and LESS.</p>

					<h3>Website Designer and Developer, Georgia Tech</h3>

					<h3>Cadet Commander, Aircraft Maintenance and Manufacturing Academy</h3>
					<p>I lead and organized a national week-long, residential academy that taught participants about aircraft manufacturing and maintenance on the live production floor.
